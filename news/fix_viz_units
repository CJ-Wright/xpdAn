**Added:**

* Units for most reduced data streams (mostly so waterfall can plot them)
* Added ``plot_graph`` to analysis server so we can visualize the graph

**Changed:**

* ``raw_stripped`` is run first, so all the aligned data can be emitted ASAP.
  This means that data can be saved as soon as it is created, rather than 
  waiting for the last data to be processed.
* Simplified the plotting via the new ``LiveWaterfall`` callback.

**Deprecated:** None
